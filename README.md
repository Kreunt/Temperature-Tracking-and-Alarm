# Temperature-Tracking-and-Alarm
An IoT project for my class INF208 that I have created with a colleague

The app tracks the relative humidity and temperature of a RPi system and sends a dynamic e‑mail to the specified e‑mail address with the information on temperature
Requires a circuit board and a humidity-temperature sensor
